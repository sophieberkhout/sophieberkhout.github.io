## About me
<img src="img/byron bay.jpg" align="right" width="33%" style="margin-left: 20px">

I am a PhD candidate at the Methodology and Statistics department of Utrecht University. 
My research focuses on intensive longitudinal methodology. 
Currently, I am working on how to study the dynamic processes in dyadic interactions and how to model data with different timescales.

I also contribute to the open-source statistics program <a href = "https://jasp-stats.org/" target="_blank">JASP</a>, 
where I am responsible for the Bayesian meta-analysis module and the -yet to come- time series module.
